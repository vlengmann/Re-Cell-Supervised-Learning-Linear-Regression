# Supervised Learning - ReCell Project

## Problem Statement
With the used and refurbished device market projected to reach $52.7 billion by 2023, driven by cost savings and environmental benefits, ReCell aims to capitalize on this growth by offering dynamic pricing for used phones and tablets.

## Objective
As a Data Scientist at ReCell, my goal within this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of used/refurbished devices and identify key factors influencing their resale value. This will support ReCellâ€™s strategy in optimizing pricing for competitive advantage in the market.

## Data Description
The dataset contains various attributes of used and refurbished phones and tablets (collected in 2021) that can impact their resale value, including:
- **brand_name**: Manufacturer brand
- **os**: Operating system
- **screen_size**: Screen size (cm)
- **4g / 5g**: Availability of 4G/5G
- **main_camera_mp / selfie_camera_mp**: Rear and front camera resolution (MP)
- **int_memory / ram**: Internal memory and RAM (GB)
- **battery**: Battery capacity (mAh)
- **weight**: Device weight (grams)
- **release_year**: Device release year
- **days_used**: Number of days used
- **normalized_new_price / normalized_used_price**: Normalized prices (euros) for new and used devices
